**Summary of my project:**
This project was focused on calculating the year-end earnings of the user
within a certain number of invested years. It would display the user's year-end
earnings, based on monthly and without monthly deposits.

**What did I do well in?**
I was pretty excited about this project, because it was challenging and intuitive. 
Within my code, I did well at separating my code into different files, for better modularity
and access. Having all my code into one file, would be bad programming practice, and so I wanted
to link them together via a source code and header file.

**How would I enhance my code?**
After I finished my project, I began to think to myself, that I could have implemented a class to better
organize my code into code blocks. That also includes me puting half of my source code, into my header file
for the purpose of the functions that I wrote to perform the calculations. If I did this prior, it would ease 
the overwhelming amount of code, that I usually write. 

**Which pieces of code were the most challenging to write?**
I would say the most difficult piece of code to write, was the display menus for both monthly deposits 
and without monthly deposits. My thought process behind this was I wanted to provide the user, a clear 
menu for display, when they put in their own investments as the programs asks them to. So, I got help 
with the use of online tutoring, and even YouTube videos to give me some insight. 

**What skills from this project will be transferable to other projects?**
From my own perspective, those skills would being able to always implement OOP to add better functionality
to my furture programs. After all, most programmers use OOP as a method to enhance their programming skills. 
I also want to add the usage of understanding how header files work, as I expand my skillset.

**How did I make this program maintainble, readable, and adaptable?**
For starters, on the maintainign side, I made my program into different sections; particularly in my source code.
I'm a person who loves attention to detail, so I wanted to emphasize my focus on separating my code into various area,
so that they have their own functions. For readability, I usually add my comments above my code, so that the user is naturally
reading my code from top to bottom, plus this is how code always runs when it's being compiled. Lastly, for adaptability, I 
would say, I had to focus on the needs of the user. Generally, in engineering, it's crucial to always think and implement 
methods for how a certain product or software will adapt to the expectations of the consumer. Overall, this project was probably,
one of my favorites, I even gave one of my closest friends the files for him ot test it out for himself.
